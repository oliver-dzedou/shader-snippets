# Shader Snippets

This is simply a compilation of useful shaderr snippets from different sources. 

## Massive Disclaimer

Nearly none of the material in this repository is original. I do not intend to steal material or pretend that I came up with it. My only goal is to simplify learning and condense it in one place. 

If you are the author of the included materials and would like me to provide a more detailed source reference, or even take down the repository, email me at:

Various shaders from Shadertoy and Reddit <br/>

## Smaller Disclaimer

Some of the examples are from Shadertoy, some are pure GLSL, some are in a markdown file as pseudocode, etc... It is a bit all over the place at the moment, and I do not have the time to unify everything, so bear with me please.

## Possible improvements

[ ] Add an explanation of what shaders are on a basic level, how and why they are used, to make the repo more beginner friendly <br/>
[ ] Add a shader learning roadmap <br/>
